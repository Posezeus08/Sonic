Project Summary:
This project involves creating a FastAPI endpoint that takes an English letter as input and returns a poet whose first name begins with that letter. The API uses the PoetryDB (https://poetrydb.org/author) as a backend service. The project also includes containerization using Docker and infrastructure-as-code using Terraform for potential cloud deployment.
Key Components:

FastAPI Application:

Endpoint: GET /poet/{letter}
Functionality: Fetches poets from PoetryDB, filters by the given letter, and returns a matching poet.
Error Handling: Provides appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.


Docker Container:

Encapsulates the FastAPI application and its dependencies.
Ensures consistency across different environments.


Terraform Configuration:

Defines infrastructure for AWS deployment.
Includes ECR repository, ECS cluster, task definition, and service.



Important Considerations:

Scalability:

The current setup uses AWS Fargate, which allows for easy scaling.
Consider implementing auto-scaling based on traffic patterns.


Performance:

The API makes a request to PoetryDB for each query. Consider implementing caching to reduce latency and load on the external API.
For high-traffic scenarios, you might want to periodically fetch and store the full list of authors locally.


Error Handling and Resilience:

Implement proper error handling for network issues, API downtime, etc.
Consider implementing retry logic for requests to PoetryDB.


Security:

Ensure proper IAM roles and policies are in place for the ECS tasks.
Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse.
Use HTTPS for all communications.


Monitoring and Logging:

Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting.
Set up monitoring using AWS CloudWatch or a third-party solution.
Create alerts for critical errors or unusual traffic patterns.


Cost Optimization:

Monitor AWS resource usage and optimize as needed.
Consider using spot instances for non-critical workloads.


CI/CD:

Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
Consider using AWS CodePipeline or a third-party solution like GitHub Actions.


Testing:

Implement unit tests for the API logic.
Set up integration tests to ensure the API works correctly with PoetryDB.
Perform load testing to understand the system's limits.


Documentation:

Provide clear API documentation, possibly using Swagger UI (which comes built-in with FastAPI).
Document the deployment process and any necessary configuration steps.


Compliance and Data Privacy:

Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
Consider data retention policies if any user data is stored.


Versioning:

Implement API versioning to allow for future updates without breaking existing integrations.


Backup and Disaster Recovery:

Implement regular backups of any persistent data.
Create a disaster recovery plan.
